        <h1>Scaling Trust</h1>
        <h4>Sep 30, 2022 | Ahmad Zeitouni - Numeus Labs</h4>


        <p>
            The need to trust is everywhere. What do we mean by this? In today’s world, we are required to place
            trust in various intermediaries to make even the simplest of our day-to-day activities possible. When
            buying groceries at the store, we are trusting our banks and card networks to process the payment.
            When using our favourite social apps, we are trusting that a private company doesn’t misuse our data.
            This does not only apply at the level of the individual, businesses large and small are required to do the
            same. Our willingness to trust has been motivated by the pursuit of convenience and humanity’s desire
            to scale. A primitive example of this trade-off can be found in the earliest forms of banking where,
            centuries ago, assets were deposited in exchange for promissory notes, allowing merchants to more
            conveniently exchange value with one another and scale their businesses through credit.
            </p>
        
        <p>As our systems and businesses have increased in complexity, we have had to scale trust to match. It is
            this interconnected web of trust between us that allows organisations to create value. The relationship
            between trust and macroeconomic growth is well documented: more trusting environments foster
            prosperity, trade, employment and economic growth. If trust has gotten us to where we are today, why
            not carry on as we have done for centuries?</p>

            <p>The problem is that trust is eroding at a time when it is arguably more important than ever. Trust today is
            multi-dimensional insofar as we place it in competent, reputable and regulated entities. These entities
            have become increasingly centralised and time has shown that these pillars have failed to protect us.
            Centralised trust points are in fact single points of failure that can be opportunistically exploited, resulting
            in a world where funds can be misappropriated, data misused and speech arbitrarily censored. The
            reasons behind the erosion of trust are many, but can likely be attributed at least in part, to repeated
            instances of corporations and institutions abusing this trust such as the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica
            data scandal. The long term effects that this erosion of trust can have, cannot be understated.</p>

            <p>What if there was a better way for us to significantly scale trust along a new dimension without the
                associated downsides? Whilst this may sound too good to be true, that’s exactly what public blockchains
                are promising to deliver. How? By decentralising control and thereby dis-intermediating trust; where
                handshakes and gentleman’s agreements are replaced with deterministic open source software that
                provides strong guarantees. Rather than relying on human trust - through a combination of cryptographic
                primitives, distributed computing and game-theoretic incentives - public blockchains harness our human
                tendency to act in our own self-interest to build networks that require no oversight yet produce positive
                outcomes for the greater good. This does not mean that we need to do away with all other forms of trust
                or human relationships (e.g. reputation, competence, regulation) but rather this enables more ‘bounded’
                forms of it, where people can more deliberately choose whom they place their trust in.</p>

            <p>Understanding these abstract concepts and the value they will unlock can be challenging, so it can help to
first look back in time at the internet to understand its core value proposition. After all there are striking
similarities in the trajectories both technologies have followed. Both the internet and cryptography were
developed by the military, were initially misunderstood and had their potential impact on the world
underestimated. This isn’t to say that blockchains are a ‘new internet’ - far from it. Blockchains should be
thought of as an additional layer of technology that sits atop the internet, adding new functionalities and
enabling new use cases that weren’t previously possible.</p>

            <p>Before the internet, the ability for information to propagate throughout the world was very limited. The
                value that the free flow of information has brought to our lives can be seen in almost everything we do –
                even in something as seemingly trivial as sending an email to a friend. Instead of needing to send a letter,
                telegram or telex message, where charges and delivery times varied depending on the destination, we
                can now send an email instantly and at practically zero cost. The frictionless exchange of information
                enabled the world to scale, facilitating international trade and innovation on an unprecedented scale.</p>

            <p>Returning to the example of sending an email to a friend - regardless of when you send it and where they
                are in the world, they’ll receive your message and be able to respond to it almost instantaneously. Yet
                when sending that same friend anything of value e.g. money, when exactly they receive it and how much
                it will cost you is largely dependent on where they are in the world. In other words, information is
                borderless, so why isn’t value?</p>

            <p>This particular example shines a spotlight on the limitations of our current systems and brings us back to
                the issue of scaling trust. Sending money, particularly across borders can take several days because unlike
                information, sending anything of value requires trust. This trust is built up over time and is incredibly
                valuable but also costly to maintain. In spite of this financial institutions are constantly having to monitor
                transactions for fraud prevention - a time consuming and costly endeavour. Blockchains allow this trust
                to be ‘outsourced’ to the network, where data records are verified and secured cryptographically.</p>
            
            
            
            <p>What then is the value proposition of this technology? In a nutshell, it is the decentralisation of control -
                however this is the means to an end. In doing so, we significantly increase our ability to scale trust
                globally, facilitating open-source development, transparency and composability between pieces of
                software, where value is treated as a first-class object and novel forms of ownership and coordination are
                made possible.</p>
                
                <p>So what does a world enabled by blockchains look like? Much like in the early days of the internet, it is
                    difficult to imagine all of the possible use cases and innovations that are yet to come. What we can do is
                    look at what is being built today to give us an idea of what the future holds:</p>
                
                <p>   - Value will flow freely. Send anything of value - be it money, a deed to a house or shares in a
                    company - as easily as sending a text message is today. Individuals and businesses will
                    transact globally in a frictionless and efficient manner. True microtransactions will enable
                    new forms of monetisation.</p>
                <p>- Data will be portable, empowering users to switch platforms effortlessly. In the absence of
                    user lock-in, services would need to compete on features and providing the best experiences
                    for their users rather than relying on their monopoly over data. No longer will we have to
                    trust whether our data is being misused or sold without our permission.</p>
                <p>- New forms of ownership mean that access to wealth-building assets is democratised.
                    Creators will have ownership in the platforms they provide content for, better aligning
                    incentives. New ways of licensing and distributing intellectual property will be made possible.
                    Software will be owned by its users.</p>
                <p>- Novel forms of privacy enabled by zero-knowledge proofs mean that you will be able to
                    cryptographically prove your eligibility for a loan without having to disclose any information
                    to the lender. Verify your identity and credentials with a universal single-sign-on.</p>
                <p>- Secure peer-to-peer communications enable once disparate systems to talk to one another in
                    real time. Intelligent devices such as autonomous vehicles will be able to seamlessly
                    communicate with their local surroundings.</p>
                <p>- Programmable value will expand the universe of assets. Derivatives, tokenised assets,
                    escrow, credit and insurance are expressed as composable pieces of code.</p>
                <p>As with any nascent technology there are teething problems, challenging hurdles to overcome and new
                    questions to be answered e.g. which trade-offs should we make in the pursuit of scalability? How can
                    privacy enhancing protocols exist within current regulatory frameworks? What is the best way to solve
                    key management for the everyday user? How do we merge existing and frontier systems?</p>
                <p>The user experience can be awkward and the learning curve is steep. However, amidst all of this there
                    are working applications and transformative products being built today with glimmers of what is still to
                    come. Assets can be traded on decentralised exchanges such as Uniswap or borrowed against on
                    decentralised lending markets like Aave, at anytime and from anywhere. Identity is portable with iDX,
                    messaging is peer-to-peer with decentralised communications networks such as XMTP, data is
                    composable with data networks such as Ceramic. Everything from exchanges and publishing houses to
                    games and marketplaces is owned by their users and contributors.</p>
                <p>For younger generations today, it can be difficult to imagine a world before the internet. Future
                    generations will find it difficult to imagine the world we currently live in - where we were forced to trust
                    blindly, rather than being allowed to choose. Blockchain’s potential to have a positive impact on our
                    world is significant and we believe it is a vision worth working towards.</p>
